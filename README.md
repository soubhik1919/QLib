# Numerical Implementation of Derivative Pricing #

This project explores the basics of numerical implementaion of derivative pricing algorithms in Python.

## Project Description ##

The objective of this project is to introduce and implement a range of models and methods to price derivative securities. All the descriptions are generally based on the classical Black-Scholes world. The Python implementations are intended to be concise and efficient while as well being accessible.
